= Editing your Node.js codebase

When your Che workspace loads, edit your project code as follows:

. In your new workspace, click the *Terminal* tab and run the following commands:
+
----
cd <app-name>
npm test
----
+

+
You can commit and push changes to your GitHub repository after the npm test succeeds.
+
. In the file explorer view, navigate to `nodejs-app` > `public` > `java` > `index.html`.

. Double-click the `index.html` file to view it in the editor and change the text on line 51 from `_using_the_greeting_service` to `_creating_a_hello_world_service`

+
. Save your changes using kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) and click the *run* option from the Run drop-down(image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This sets up the Node.js server. Unlike in the Vert.x Quickstart project, the hot deploy option is not available for Node.js applications. As a result, changes are not automatically deployed.

. You can see the application run in the *run* tab. When the application run completes, click the blue preview URL at the top of the *run* tab to see your project.

The application displays the changes in a new browser tab.
