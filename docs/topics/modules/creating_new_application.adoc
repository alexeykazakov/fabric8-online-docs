. In the *Create an application* screen:

.. In the *Name your application* field, type `helloworldvertx`.

.. Select the *Create a new codebase* radio button and click btn:[Continue].
//. The *Create a new codebase* radio button is auto-selected since you clicked btn:[Create New Codebase] when you first created the space. Click btn:[Continue].

. Select the mission and runtime for your new project:

.. In the *Select a mission* section, select the *REST API Level 0* option.
.. In the *Select a runtime* section, select *Eclipse Vert.x*.
.. Click the blue down-arrow button to continue.

. In the *Create an application* screen:

.. In the *Name your application* field, type a unique name for your new project. Ensure that the application name adheres to the listed *Naming Requirements*. For this example type *nodejs-app* to create a Node.js application.

.. Select the *Create a new codebase* radio button and click btn:[Continue].
//. The *Create a new codebase* radio button is auto-selected since you clicked btn:[Create New Codebase] when you first created the space. Click btn:[Continue].

. Select the mission and runtime for your new project:

.. In the *Select a mission* section, select *Health Check*.
.. In the *Select a runtime* section, select *Node.js*. The gray arrow at the bottom of the screen now turns blue.
.. Click the blue down-arrow button to continue.

. Click btn:[Set Up Application] to create the new application. The progress screen displays a confirmation message when your application is ready.
. Once your application is ready, you can do one of the following:

* Return to the _dashboard_ to see the details of the application deployed on stage, a detailed stack analysis report, and the codebase you added.
* View your continuous integration _pipelines_
* Edit your application codebase in _Che web IDE_.
